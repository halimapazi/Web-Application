drink with a distinct aroma and flavor, prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds found 
inside "barriers" of the coffee plant. Coffee plants are cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily 
in equatorial latin America, Southest Asia, India and Africa. The two most commonly grown are 
the highly regarded Arabica, and the less Sophisticated but stronger and more hardy robusta.

ripe, coffee beans are picked, processed, and dried. Green(Unroasted) coffee beans are one of the 
most traded agricultural commodities in the world. Once traded, the beans are roasted to varying 
degrees, depending on the desired flavor, before being ground and brewed to create coffee.

contents its one of the most popular drinks in the world. It can be prepared and presented in a 
variety of ways, the effect of coffee on human health has been a subject of many studies;
